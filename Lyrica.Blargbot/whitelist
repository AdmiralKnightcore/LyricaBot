        **How to use**
        `b!whitelist` This shows the help command.
        `b!whitelist add <ign>` This adds you to the whitelist. This means your in game name.
        `b!whitelist remove` This removes your request. You can run the add command again if you would like to rename the ign included in the whitelist.
